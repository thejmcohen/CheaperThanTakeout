# How Brining Works

Denaturing is what happens when salt comes into contact with meat. The salt causes the protein strands in the meat to unwind. When this happens, moisture gets caught between these strands. After a while the protein strands change their structure, tangle with one another and the moisture is trapped inside.

Why is this important? Because during the cooking process, moisture is forced out of the meat. With all of that extra moisture trapped inside the protein strands, the moisture is not forced out quite as easily.

# Wet Brine

In my experience, wet brining works best on leaner, more delicate meat such as poultry, fish and seafood

Wet Brining – soaking meat, chicken, fish, etc. in a solution of salt and liquid and possibly other less-essential ingredients to add flavor and more moisture. This solution is made up of a ratio of 1 gallon of liquid (usually water) and 1 cup of kosher salt.

The caveat might be poultry with skin since these are bad about ending up rubbery when cooking at low and slow temperatures.. the extra water just doesn't help that situation. To combat this, you can use dry brining methods or let the poultry spend some time in the fridge drying AFTER you brine it and BEFORE you smoke it.

# Dry Brine

Dry brining works best for fattier and more robust cuts such as beef, pork, and lamb. This would also include wild game such as deer, elk, etc.

Dry Brining – Applying salt to the surface of meats to add flavor to the inside and to help lock in the moisture that is already present. Kosher salt is usually added at a rate of ½ to 3/4 teaspoon per pound of meat

Unlike wet brining poultry, the salt is added directly to the meat. We're not adding extra moisture to the steaks during the dry brining process but that doesn't mean it doesn't end up more juicy.

Salt is added to the top of steak, chops, etc. at a rate of ~½ teaspoon per pound of meat. I often go a little higher than this and use closer to ~¾ teaspoon per pound although I don't generally measure. Once you've been doing this for a long time you start to get a little intuition about how much salt to use.

After just a few minutes, the salt begins to pull moisture to the surface of the meat.

That moisture dissolves the salt and becomes a salty solution (it makes its own brine in essence).

Eventually that salty brine gets reabsorbed back into the meat. This entire process happens over the course of  a few hours.

The perfect scenario is to salt the meat and wait about 5-10 minutes for the juices to start coming to the surface. Now you can add your seasoning to the meat and it will stick to the surface with no need for a binder such as oil, mustard, etc.

# Which is Best? Wet Brining or Dry Brining?

That is not a question that can be answered directly however, each of these methods have properties which will help you decide which is best for the type of meat you are wanting to cook.

Dry Brining:

Best for fattier cuts such as brisket, pork butt, etc. as well as all steaks regardless of fat content.
Does not add extra moisture to the meat.
Less messy
Saltiness not as uniform as in wet brining.
Wet Brining:

Best for thinner, leaner cuts such as pork loin, chicken breast, fish, etc with the exception of poultry with skin which is best dry brined.
Messier than dry brining
More uniform salting than in dry brining.
Adds extra moisture to the meat.
